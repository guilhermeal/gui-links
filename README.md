- The `<html>` element is the root element of the document.
- The `<head>` element contains information about the document, such as the title and links to external resources.
- The `<body>` element contains the visible content of the document.

The `<body>` element is divided into several sections:

- The `<div id="container">` element contains the main content of the website.
- The `<div id="profile">` element contains the profile section.
- The `<div id="switch">` element contains the switch for changing the theme.
- The `<div id="links">` element contains the links to GitHub projects.
- The `<div id="social">` element contains the links to social media profiles.
